## Description
We are UCLA Bootcamp Feb 2023 Group 4. We built an app that translate English into different languages. Instead of using 1 translator source like other common app, we decided to build an app that use 2 sources, so users can compare the results and find the best result for that language. Our app use APTs from Google translate and DeepL. The app also highlight the differences in the results, so that users can easily compare them.
